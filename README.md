To **add your first arrear** you need to create a category. To do so take these steps:
1. Click the *DODAJ ZALEGŁOŚĆ* button and select *KATEGORIĘ*
2. Now you need to select the specific category *Filmy* (films), *Seriale* (series), *Gry* (games), *Książki* (books) or *Różne* (other). It will select specific icon for your category
3. Enter the category name and click *OK*

If you have your first category you can now create some arrears:
1. Click the *DODAJ ZALEGŁOŚĆ* button and select *ZALEGŁOŚĆ*
2. Select in which category the new arrear should append
3. Enter the arrear name and click *OK*

The new arrear should appear in a second. Remember to check completed tasks or delete them if you want to clear the app a little bit (you can hide the arrear list for category if you want)

Application is easy to use so feel free to test it!
